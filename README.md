## Problem
In modern times of security, Surveillance cameras are making their way into the domestic markets as well. It becomes a very tedious task to go through tens of hours of footage to check for any suspicious activity in the area. It also takes a lot of memory to store these long videos, and sometimes the resolution of the video is compromised to save memory. There is a need for surveillance solutions that can abridge such long footage into short videos while still retaining important events.

* CCTV footage analysis takes a lot of time and man power.
* Due to memory limits, lengthy videos cannot be recorded and hacks such as reducing video quality are applied to combat this.
* Important clues can be overlooked during CCTV footage analysis because the amount of video to analyze is too much.
* Response rate to tackle violence caught by CCTV camera is very low.

## Proposed Solution
* A system that is able to take a long CCTV footage and summarize it into a short, abridged, synopsis of the event.
* A system able to make CCTV cameras retain lengthy videos at max quality.
* A system that is able to automatically detect and identify violence and raise an alarm on time.

## Benefit
* Reduce in time and man power spent analyzing CCTV footage.
* Reduce in error or overlooked signs in CCTV footage analysis.
* CCTV cameras can now store lengthy videos at max quality.
* Increase in the response rate to violence caught by CCTV cameras.

## Proposed Stack
* Web (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Flask
