## Problem
* CCTV footage analysis takes a lot of time and man power.
* Important clues can be overlooked during CCTV footage analysis because the amount of video to analyse is too much.
* Response rate to tackle violence caught by CCTV camera is very low.

## Proposed Solution
* A system that is able to take a long CCTV footage and summarize it into a short, abridged, synopsis of the event.
* A system that is able to automatically detect and identify violence and raise an alarm on time.

## Benefit
* Reduce in time and man power spent analysing CCTV footage.
* Reduce in error or overlooked signs in CCTV footage analyis.
* Increase in the response rate to violence caught by CCTV cameras.

## Proposed Stack
* Web (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Django | Flask
* Tensorflow | PyTorch | Scikit-Learn
